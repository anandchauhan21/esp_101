# 📌 ESP_101 — Embedded Systems with ESP32/ESP8266
## 🚀 Overview

ESP_101 is a beginner-friendly but real-world-ready starter repository for learning embedded systems using ESP32 and ESP8266 microcontrollers.
If you want to build connected devices, smart sensors, IoT systems, and robotics controller modules — this is your FIRST step.

This project shows you how to connect sensors, read data, control outputs, and integrate with software stacks like Python, Wi-Fi, and cloud.

## 🎯 Who Is This For?
```
✔ Students learning embedded systems
✔ Beginners in IoT & Robotics
✔ Developers transitioning from Python to hardware
✔ Teachers looking for classroom demos
✔ Startups prototyping connected devices
```
If you want hands-on experience with ESP32/ESP8266 programming that goes beyond theory, this repo is for you.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn
```
By working with this repository you’ll:
✔ Flash ESP32/ESP8266 boards with real code
✔ Interface sensors (DHT, Ultrasonic, etc.)
✔ Read and send sensor data over Wi-Fi
✔ Control actuators (LEDs, relays, motors)
✔ Build a basis for advanced robotics projects
```
This is the foundation for IoT + robotics + automation careers.
